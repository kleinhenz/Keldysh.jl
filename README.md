# Keldysh.jl

[![Build Status](https://github.com/kleinhenz/Keldysh.jl/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/kleinhenz/Keldysh.jl/actions)

`Keldysh.jl` provides a set of tools for working with non-equilibrium Keldysh Green's functions.
It contains types to represent contours, grids defined on these contours, and two-time Green's functions defined on these grids.
Additionally, it provides functions for generating Green's functions, performing integration on a contour and hdf5 serialization.


Credit to Andrey Antipov and Igor Krivenko for designing a first version of the abstractions implemented here.

## Usage
The following code generates a non-equilibrium Green's function from a spectral density and saves it to an hdf5 archive
```Julia
using Keldysh, HDF5

contour = twist(Contour(full_contour, tmax=1.0, Î²=5.0))
grid = TimeGrid(contour, npts_real=11, npts_imag=51)
dos = Keldysh.flat_dos(D=10.0)
gf = dos2gf(dos, grid)
h5write("output.h5", "/gf", gf)
```

[anderson_nca.jl](examples/anderson_nca.jl) implements a NCA solver for the anderson impurity model using `Keldysh.jl`.
